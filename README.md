# About
IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is a popular platform for movie enthusiasts to explore and rate movies. Predicting IMDb scores can be valuable for filmmakers, studios, and audiences alike. In this project, we aim to predict IMDb scores for movies using a machine learning approach.

# Data Analysis
We performed thorough data analysis on a dataset containing various features of movies such as genre, director, actors, budget, and more. Our analysis includes:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Visualization of Key Insights

# Machine Learning Model
To predict IMDb scores, we developed a machine learning model. We used a dataset split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. The model includes the following steps:

# Feature Engineering
Model Selection (Ridge Regression)
Hyperparameter Tuning
Evaluation Metrics (Mean Absolute Error, R-squared)

# Getting Started
